    "I am going to use logistic regression classification model to predict the probability of a house being more expensive than the mean of our list of houses. For the real estate dataset, the mean price of homes is 37.980 per unit. I am going to use the transaction date, the house age, distance to metro stations, and number of conviencience stores to predict the probability of a house being more expensive than `meanPrice` of homes. After creating a logistic model and creating a confusion matrix, we resulted a test error of 16.9%. In other words, our model predicted correctly 83.1% of the time if a home was more expensive than the `meanPrice` of homes. "
