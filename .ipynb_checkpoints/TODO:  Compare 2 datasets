#TODO: Compare split datasets and document difference/intuition
"""
Property Age: The slightly lower mean age in the first part suggests it contains somewhat newer properties on average 
compared to the second part. This could imply a minor difference in potential property value due to age.

Proximity to MRT Stations: The first part has properties slightly closer to MRT stations on average, as indicated by the 
lower mean distance. Closer proximity to public transport can positively affect property values.

Number of Convenience Stores: Both parts show a similar average number of convenience stores nearby, indicating that 
the split did not significantly segregate properties based on this urban convenience factor.

House Price of Unit Area: The first part has a higher average house price, which, coupled with its slightly newer 
properties and closer proximity to MRT stations, might suggest these factors play a role in property valuation.

Geographical Distribution: The very close means for latitude and longitude in both parts indicate a geographically 
consistent split, ensuring that any spatial analysis will be representative of the entire dataset.

Variability in Data: The standard deviations show that there is a broad range of values within each feature across both 
splits, indicating variability and diversity within the dataset that is crucial for robust analysis.

Conclusion:
The two dataset splits are well-balanced across key features, making them suitable for further analysis or model 
training/testing. The minor differences observed align with intuitive expectations 
about the impact of age, proximity to MRT stations, and urban conveniences on property prices. 
These insights affirm the dataset's integrity for conducting comprehensive real estate market analyses.
